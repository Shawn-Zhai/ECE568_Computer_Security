Part 1
Q1 run command <dig utoronto.ca A>, the IPv4 address is in the answer section
Q2 run command <dig utoronto.ca A>, the name servers and their IPv4 addresses is in the additional secion
Q3 run command <dig utoronto.ca MX>, then run command <dig utoronto-ca.mail.protection.outlook.com A>,
   the name servers and their IPv4 addresses are in the answer secion
Q4 add <@127.0.0.1 -p <listen-on port> after 'dig' in each of the above command to verify

Part 2
A DNS proxy server is built to intercept and forward DNS queries between a client and a specified BIND DNS server. 
The proxy listens for DNS queries on a designated port, then sends these queries to the BIND server. Upon receiving 
the DNS responses from the BIND server, the proxy relays these responses back to the original client, making the DNS
query and response process transparent to the client.

Part 3
Extending the proxy server in part 2, forge fake DNS replies can be forged when example.com is queried using dig. 
After forwarding the request to BIND, its response is modified with scapy APIs. The IPv4 address is changed to 1.2.3.4 
and the name servers are changed to ns.dnslabattacker.net.

Part 4
send query for non-existing names first. Forge a response that "poisons" example.com by changing the NS region.
Then  flood it with many spoofed DNS replies each with random transaction ID and hope one is correct. Do this repeatedly
until success. Then by checking BIND response, the poison attack can be confirmed.
